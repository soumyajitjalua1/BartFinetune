A fine-tuned BART model for detecting spam SMS messages with state-of-the-art performance. Achieves **98% accuracy** and **96% F1-score** on spam detection.


## Overview
This repository contains a BART-based text classification model fine-tuned on the SMS Spam Collection dataset. The model demonstrates exceptional performance in distinguishing spam messages from legitimate (ham) messages, making it suitable for real-world SMS filtering applications.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) which contains:
- 5,572 SMS messages
- Class balance: 747 spam (13.4%) / 4,825 ham (86.6%)
- Raw text data with original category labels

## Features
- **High-Performance Metrics**
  - 98% Overall Accuracy
  - 97% Precision and 96% Recall for Spam Class
  - F1-Score: 96% for Spam Detection
- **Production-Ready Inference**
  - Simple prediction API with Hugging Face `pipeline`
  - Optimized for low-latency processing
- **Advanced NLP Architecture**
  - BART-base model with classification head
  - Handles complex spam patterns and obfuscated text

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies:
  ```bash
  transformers>=4.20.0
  torch>=1.10.0
  pandas>=1.3.0
  scikit-learn>=1.0.0
  numpy>=1.20.0
  datasets>=2.0.0
  ```

# Quick Start
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the trained model
classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="spam_classifier")

# Example prediction
sample_message = "WINNER! Claim your free iPhone now! Text YES to 12345."
result = classifier(sample_message)

print(f"Message: {sample_message}")
print(f"Prediction: {result[0]['label']} (confidence: {result[0]['score']:.2f})")
```

## Model Performance

| Metric | Ham Class | Spam Class | Overall |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Accuracy | - | - | 98.2% |
| Precision | 99.1% | 97.4% | - |
| Recall | 98.8% | 96.3% | - |
| F1-Score | 98.9% | 96.1% | - |

How It Works

The model uses a pre-trained BART model as the base
It's fine-tuned on the SMS Spam Collection dataset
BART's sequence classification capabilities are leveraged for binary classification
The model learns to identify patterns and language typically associated with spam messages
